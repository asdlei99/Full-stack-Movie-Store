		<h1>Substring Matching Report </h1>
		<hr>
		<p>We utilized 'like' SQL operator for pattern matching. </p>
		
		<p>We utilized like 'title %' to process 'browse by title' because browse by title only 
		requires browsing by the first letter thus everything after should match.
		The use of this format could be found in processes/browse.jsp </p>
		
		<p>We utilized like '% sample %' to process 'search' because the substring match should
		allow users to search for data given an input that have 'sample' in any position of the input.</p>
